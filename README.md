# Hostel-Management-System
“Hostel Management System” is a software/web project developed for managing various activities in the hostel. This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually. We have made an attempt to build a software/website for our institution for managing its own hostels activities and management which on later can be used for other institutions if required.
